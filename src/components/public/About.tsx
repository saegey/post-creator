        Our Journey
      </Text>
      <Text as="p" variant="aboutParagraph">
        Our journey began as a solo venture, fueled by a racer's desire to
        redefine the way cyclists and triathletes engage with their experiences
        on roads, trails, and during multi-disciplinary events. Rooted in the
        picturesque landscapes of the Pacific Northwest, Monopad Journal was
        conceptualized to be more than just a tracking app â€“ it's a companion on
        your journey to mastering various terrains and disciplines.
